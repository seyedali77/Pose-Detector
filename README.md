# Pose-Detector
A real-time pose detection system using OpenCV and MediaPipe. This project detects human pose landmarks from a video or webcam feed and visualizes them on the image.
# Features
. Detects and tracks human pose landmarks in real-time

. Draws pose landmarks and connections using MediaPipe

. Extracts landmark positions in pixel coordinates

. Displays frames per second (FPS) for performance monitoring

# Example Output
The script detects pose landmarks and highlights them on the image.
The FPS is displayed in the top left corner of the frame.

# Future Improvements
.  Add support for multiple persons
  
. Implement angle calculations for fitness applications
  
. Enhance performance with model optimization
